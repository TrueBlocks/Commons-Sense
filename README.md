# Commons Sense

## Introduction

This GitHub repo is an experiment in the process of creating an NFT.

The goal of this exercise is to create a series of five images, each, ultimately, being made into its own NFT.

By paying careful attention to hashes produced by `git commit` and through the use of a smart contract and the content-addressable data store IPFS, we hope to demonstrate just how perfect the provenance for a work of art can be.

We intend to demonstrate with perfect clarity the production of a series of images called `Commons Sense". The underlying message is that, while these new decentralizing technologies allow people to create brand new ways of interacting with each other, the current direction of these systems is headed anywhere but in that directly. You'll get the idea as you peruse the image.

## Work in Progress

This is very much as work in progress. Expect everything to change in every way as we move forward. We are exploring new territory, so knowing where we're headed is not possible.

## The Folder Structure of this Repo

There are six folders in this repo. Each has its own README file describing the contents of that folder. An overview of the folders is presented here:

1. **01_Originals**. One of us (Thomas Rush) created hand-drawn images containing the seed ideas for each image. The crudely drawn images were scanned to PDFs files which are stored in this folder.

2. **02_PNGs**. PNG screen shots were captured from the PDFs.

3. **03_Descriptions**. Each PNG image was copied into a Microsoft word document and the first draft of the idea was described in very rough format. This might be considered the first rough draft of the idea. An issue was created to track each idea as it moved forward.

4. **04_First_Drafts**. The first draft of each idea produced by Ivano Nardacchione is contained in this folder. Comments about these images can be found in the corresponding issue. The images in this folder will be stored on IPFS and the IPFS hashes will be attached to the filenames. Instructions for using IPFS to retreive these images can be found in the issues.

5. **Second Drafts**. In this folder we place the second draft of each image. Note that there may have been more than a single revision between the first draft and what we will call the second draft. IPFS images of these files and the IPFS locations recorded here will be stored as well.

6. **Final Draft**. This will be the actual image that is made into the NFT. Once the images are made final, no further changes will be made. The NFT smart contracts will reference the IPFS hashes of these images. Once posted, it will not be possible to change the IPFS hash in the NFT smart contract.  These images will, of course, be stored on IPFS and the IPFS hash posted.

## Turning it into an NFT

Once the above steps are completed and we have five images that we consider final, then we will figure out how best to make the NFT smart contracts and place the items out for the public. Stay tuned.
