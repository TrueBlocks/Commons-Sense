## Introduction

This repo is an experiement in creating an NFT. The final goal is a series of five images, each of which will be its own NFT.

This repo attempts to document each NFT from it's birth as an idea to its ultimate realization as a physical image in the world (a digital image), though the development and production of the smart contracts that consistute the NFT and then through to tracking the life cycle of the NFT by watching and monitoring the image throughout its life.

This is the first, alpha version of this work contained in this repo.

## Folders

There are six folders in this repo. Each has its own README file describing that folder. An overview of the folders is presented here:

1. **Original PDFs**. One of us (Thomas Rush) created hand-drawn images with the first seed idea for each image. The crudely drawn images were scanned to PDFs files which are stored in this folder.

2. **PNG Copies**. PNG screen shots were captured from the PDFs.

3. **Word Docs**. Each PNG image was copied into a Microsoft word document and the first draft of the general idea of the image was described in these word documents. This might be considered the first rough draft of the idea.

4. **First Drafts**. The first draft of each idea produced by the artist is contained in this folder. Also in this folder are comments (produced as each image is being produced) used to move from the first draft to the second draft to the final image. The images in this folder will be posted to IPFS and the IPFS hashes posted here.

5. **Second Drafts**. In this folder we place the second draft of each image. Note that there may have been more than a single revision between the original first draft and what we call the second draft. The first draft is the first image. The second draft is the image as it evolves.

6. **Final Draft**. This is the image that finally got turned into the NFT. No further changes will be made to the image after this point. This image will be stored on IPFS and the IPFS hash posted here.

## Turning it into an NFT

Once the above steps are completed and we have five images that we consider final, then we will figure out how best to make the NFT smart contracts and place the items out for the public. Stay tuned.
